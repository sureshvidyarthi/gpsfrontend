    <h1>Durga Puja</h1>
    <p>Durga Puja (Bengali: দুর্গা পূজা), also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsava, is an annual Hindu festival
        originating in
        the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga and is also celebrated because
        of
        Durga's victory over Mahishasur.[3][4] It is celebrated all over the world by the Hindu Bengali community but it
        is
        particularly popular and traditionally celebrated in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Tripura,
        Odisha,
        Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts) and the country of Bangladesh. The festival is observed in the Indian
        calendar
        month of Ashwin, which corresponds to September–October in the Gregorian calendar.[5][6] Durga Puja is a ten-day
        festival,[7][3] of which the last five are of the most significance.</p>
